# Welcome To Modern C# MasterClass Course

The main intention of this course is to provide you with an organized, comprehensive and engaging knowledge transfer of modern C#.

## Organized

We have spent immense amount of time organizing the course to make sure it is intuitive and structured. This way making it easier to recall concepts after learning them.

## Comprehensive

The challenge here is to keep information complete yet not overwhelming. Our approach is to focus on fully covering concepts widely-used by professional .NET developers on daily basis, while skipping those which are not.

## Engaging

Keeping theory to the minimum, providing clear and animated examples with hands-on coding exercises will keep things fun throughout the course.

Please check below to see all of the latest concepts covered in the course (more will be added overtime):
